# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes changed?
I think I am those things; adapability, responsibility, restorative, positivity, and ideation. However right now I am a learner, a student. I am not in a position to assert any of my strengths in an environment I am flailing in. I have been positive and I think that shows, also adapative, but that's about it. 


* How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? Where are you stronger now than on day 1?
I am in full understanding of the structure and the expectations of how things go. With knowing what to expect I can alter things a bit. I would say I am stronger, less ideological, and more focused. 


* Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?
As a strong determined person, who is fighting for it. 


* How might these themes play a role in describing your Turing story?
I came in the developer un developer. I had to lose and have some hard hits but you get up and keep going. This is my first iteration with academic or school failures. It's hard, and hard to manage when you have people and a family depending on you. 


* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?
I will graduate and I will learn to kill JS. I will have started off slow and low but I will get better, I will finish in a good place.
