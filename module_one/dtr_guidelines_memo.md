# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation. 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
I hope to learn how to operate within JS better 
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
I am very communicative, I like to have a plan and execute it accordingly. I am all for paired programming and talking through the code since I am very new, I want as much hands on collaboration as possiible. 
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others? 
I am ok with written ie, slack, text, email and in person styles. 
* How would you describe your work style?
I like to work then break, and come back to it. I also like to talk through the steps of what's happening as it's occuring in real time. 
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
I can be organized, also research and solutions based, 
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
I've always done well with others, I have had lazy partners in the past. 
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Define what our outcomes are, what phase do we want to get to in the project. 
* How will we overcome obstacles?
We can talk about them or write them down 
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Collaborative 
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
I am unable to stay late due to having a family. I can once or twice a week with notice, however weekends are best for in person pairing. Also I am available in the evenings. 
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Be honest, direct, solutions oriented, and kind. Speak to me with the outcome of resolution in mind 
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?  
Unsure as of right now, I have not yet had a successful pairing opportunity at Turing 
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
I've heard of waffle and slack and of course the Mac Book
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Talk about them at the moment they occur no festering concerns or issues for later

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Communicate, work hard, collaborate, allow for others to have input, think outside of the box, and be open to new ways of doing things. 
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
Open and honest and as a group win!
